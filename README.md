This project is meant to study the Raylib library and experiment with implementing various 2D platformer mechanics, such as movement, jumping, double jumping, dashing, and more.
I'm currently working on Windows using w64devkit, as recommended in the [Raylib repository](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/wiki/Working-on-Windows).
Iâ€™ll probably add a Makefile for Linux support in the future as well.
